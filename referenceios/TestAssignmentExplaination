I've build a Page Object Modal. I've did this just because it's a very nice
way of building your test framework and helps to reduce duplicate code when the
project grows. If the app would stay as small as it is now, I wouldn't put in
the effort of building a POM framework.

The POM framework contains a folder Screens, this is where the BaseScreen is,
which would contain basic screen elements that are applicable in the entire
app.
And A screenfile per screen, in this case just the MainScreen.
In the MainScreen class I define the elements which I will use for testing
as well as the functions that I will execute on this screen.

In the Tests folder the different tests are defined,
the BaseTest contains the functions applicable to all tests,
such as the setup and teardown.

I have created two tests, the first one is InitialLabelTest,
it checks to see if the label is "Hello" when I launch the app.
The second one is ChangeLabelTest,
it checks that the label has changed after pushing the button.

I also edited the Fastfile for fastline,
so that it can execute the tests on two simulators.
This is to easily expand the coverage over several devices using fastlane.
It could also be executed using the xcode build tools:

xcodebuild \
 -scheme ReferenceiOSUITests \
 -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone X,OS=12.1' \
 -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 8 Plus,OS=12.1' \
 test
